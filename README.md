## Installation

Included in the repo are both the client and server versions of the modpack. Playing on your own? Just install the client modpack. You can also find the client version on Curseforge (link tbd). 

Remember that any mods on the server should also be on the client. Fabric versions don't need to match, so as long as the mods work correctly on both you'll be okay.
